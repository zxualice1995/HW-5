In Knight Rider, why does each LED require its own pin?
    So the LED would blink in sequence, one by one using the code.
    
Why is Knight Rider 2 in the Arduino tutorial so much shorter than Knight Rider 1?
    Because with the for loop, it will continue without having to write so many code. 

What resistor value should be used with the LEDs?
    470 ohm resistor (yellow - violet - brown) and 1/4W, 5% or better for the resisitor.
